# custom-go-swagger-model-gen

Custom Dockerized swagger models generation for go-lang.

Command to generate models is `docker-compose up`.

We can make format changes in the `custom-swagger-formats.go` and the models will be generated.

Examples: 

1. Do not need `UUID` as field type, instead use `string`.
